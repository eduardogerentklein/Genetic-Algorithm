# Genetic Algorithm | The Knapsack Problem
This repository provides an efficient Python implementation to solve the ["Knapsack Problem"](https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpack-problem/) using dynamic programming. The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where a set of items, each with a weight and value, must be selected to maximize the total value while staying within a given weight constraint.

## Dependencies
You'll need to have python v3.8 or greater. If you don't have it installed, you can download it over [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to run
```
